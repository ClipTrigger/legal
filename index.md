## 2. Disclaimer & External Links  

ClipTrigger (“the App”) is an **unofficial, community-driven overlay** built with the Overwolf SDK.  
It is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by** Overwolf Ltd., Psyonix LLC / Epic Games (Rocket League), Riot Games, Google LLC (YouTube™) or any other trademark holder.  
All product names, logos and brands are property of their respective owners.

External links (e.g. YouTube videos) lead to third-party content over which we have no control; the respective provider is solely responsible.

### 2.1 User-generated Clips & Acceptable-Use Policy  

* **User responsibility.** You are fully responsible for every clip, screenshot or media file you create, upload, stream or share via ClipTrigger.  
* **Rights & licences.** By using the App you confirm that you **own or have secured all necessary rights** to any content you post or broadcast, or that such content is expressly free to use (e.g. licence-free, public-domain, or covered by fair-use/quotation law).  
* **No liability.** ClipTrigger, its developer (Simon Rambow) and any contributors **assume no liability for the legality, accuracy or decency** of user-generated content.  
* **Prohibited content.** We do **not permit the creation, storage or distribution** of  
  * illegal content (including but not limited to child sexual abuse material, extremist propaganda, copyrighted material without authorisation)  
  * pornography or sexually explicit material intended for sexual arousal  
  * gratuitous real-world violence, gore or hate content.  
  Violations may lead to deletion of content, suspension of service features, or—where required—reports to the competent authorities.  
* **Streaming & public display.** If you stream clips captured with ClipTrigger, you must ensure that doing so complies with the Terms of Service of the relevant platform (e.g. Twitch, YouTube), local broadcasting laws and the rights of all third parties depicted.

### 2.2 Advertising & Premium Service  

To keep ClipTrigger free, we **plan to display advertising** (video clips and static banners) delivered via the **Overwolf Ads SDK**.  
* Ads are selected by Overwolf; we do not receive personal data about you. Overwolf may use device identifiers, approximate location or language settings to show relevant ads (see their privacy policy).  
* A future **Premium subscription** will remove all third-party ads from the App.  
* Advertising will never override or obstruct core gameplay UI, and ad audio will be muted by default unless you choose otherwise.
